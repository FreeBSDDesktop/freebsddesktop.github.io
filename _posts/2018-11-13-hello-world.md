# Hello, World!

A blog is born.

This blog is one part of many in a new initiative to refresh and update support and documentation for everything related to a better experience using FreeBSD on desktop and laptop computers. 

Stay tuned for regular updates about the progress that's made and what is waiting around the corner.

Cheers!
